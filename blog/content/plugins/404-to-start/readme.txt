Send 404 page not found error directly to start page (or any other page/site) to overcome problems with search engines. With optional email alert.

== Description ==

If you don't like the typical 404 page than you can redirect all 404 page not found errors permantly (or temporarily) to the start page or any other site/page you like.

This will help you solve problems with external bad links which are not under your influence.

Chose between 301 - Moved permanently (default) and 302 - Moved temporarily.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `404 to Start` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Adjust settings

== Remove plugin ==

1. Deactivate plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
2. Delete plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

It's best to use the build in delete function of wordpress. That way all the stored data will be removed and no orphaned data will stay.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 301 or 302? =

It is generally not recommended to use a 302 redirect unless you are a search engine expert and can make a unique redirect page for each search engine. Each of the three major search engines (Google, Yahoo and MSN) process 302 redirects in a different manner.
